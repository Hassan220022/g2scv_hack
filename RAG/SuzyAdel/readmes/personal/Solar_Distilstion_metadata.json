  "description": "The Pyramid Solar Distillation (PSD) system simulates solar desalination, using solar energy to purify saline water. It models solar radiation, evaporation, condensation, and salt concentration to optimize fresh water production. The project includes 24-hour cycle simulations, energy balance calculations, and visualizations of key metrics like salt",
